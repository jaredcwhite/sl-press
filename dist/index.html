<h1>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h1>

<h2>By Arthur Conan Doyle</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee.”</p>
  <p>— <em>A Study in Scarlet</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Adventure of the Copper Beeches</h3>

<p>“To the man who loves art for its own sake,” remarked <strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong>, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, “it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes <em>célèbres</em> and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.”</p>

<p>“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood—“you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,” I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character.</p>

<p>“No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.”</p>

<p>It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the <a href="#">old room at Baker Street</a>. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.</p>

<h3>The Red-Headed League</h3>

<p>I had called upon my friend, <a href="#">Mr. Sherlock Holmes</a>, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.</p>

<p>“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,” he said cordially.</p>

<p>“I was afraid that you were engaged.”</p>

<p>“So I am. Very much so.”</p>

<p>“Then I can wait in the next room.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.”</p>

<p>The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.</p>
